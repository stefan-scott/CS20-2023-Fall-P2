# A quick look at python i/o operations  - ONE-LINE DESC.

# Ask user for name
# name = input("what's your name? ")
# print("Nice to meet you, " + name)
# print("Nice to meet you," , name, "!!!") #this way adds a space
#input ALWAYS yields a string
#  int() → converts to an int
#  float() → converts to a float


amount = input("how many candies do you want? ")
amount = int(amount)

cost = amount * 5  #five cent candies
print("That will cost you", cost, "cents.")
